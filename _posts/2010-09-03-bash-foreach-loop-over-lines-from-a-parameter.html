<p>Another quick bash example where the ratio of time-spent-searching to ease-of-code was pretty bad...</p>
<p>You have a  command (in this case ls -1) you want to iterate over each line from the command to test for something. Do as follows:</p>
<pre>ls -1 /usr/java | 
while read line; do
    if [ "${line}" = "jdk1.5" ] then
        echo "Time to upgrade"
    fi 
done</pre>
<p>The contents of the if statement are unimportant. We pipe the multiple lines from ls in to a while loop (using the vertical bar on line 2). The while lets us declare a variable "line" for each row from ls. "line" can then be tested / manipulated as you like.</p>
