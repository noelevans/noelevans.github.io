<p>I have found and lost this data set a number of times. This comes from <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/">NASA</a>, showing a non-linear (quadratic) trend to climate change data with seasonal variation each year. This is the <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/499_GRN_ANT_mass_changes.csv">data</a>Â to generate their graph.</p>
