<p>This is a chance to obtain a real 80`s classic road bike. Frame size is 59cm, the top tube is 56cm in length (.Built by John Hardisty of Newcastle).Would fit rider of 6ft plus. Crankset is Campagnolo 53/39, pedals Shimano ( look cleat). The rear block is a 7 speed Regin. Front and rear mech are both campag also. The brakeset is Campag, as is the seatpost. Stem and bars both Cinelli, wheels are Mavic Ma40 on Campag hubs 32/32, DB spokes. Tyres and tubes are very new, Racelite. Saddle is Selle Italia Turbo. Everything works as you would expect, although the existing Synchro levers may need adjusting, but work OK. As you can see the paint is in good condition for age, ( it has been refinished at some time.) This is a beautiful machine, and these days quite a classic. Buyer to collect from near High Wycombe, by arrangement.Paypal or cash upon collection. I would not wish to risk posting! If you have further questions, please ask. Good luck, and happy bidding </p>
