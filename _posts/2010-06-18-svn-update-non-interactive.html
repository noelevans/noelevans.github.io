<p>Subversion documentation can sometimes seem quite scant. If you want to use command line svn to update a series of folders, automatically merging each file that needs to be, use</p>
<p>svn update --non-interactive</p>
<p>This will keep away the prompts: "Conflict discovered in "</p>
<p>Instead some of the updated files might/will get some of the markings as below but your compiler should make that obvious later<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine<br />
=======<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r191289</p>
