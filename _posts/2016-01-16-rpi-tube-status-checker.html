Like most Londoners I depend on the Underground system to get to the office where I am on a contract. A delay or suspension can cause big problems for the morning commute so I decided to put my Raspberry Pi to use, alerting of problems on the tube network before heading out the door. I used TFL's API: status to check how the lines are running and put the Piglow I had to use – one arm for the Metropolitan line, one for the Jubilee line, the final arm for the other lines combined (I get to work using just the Met and Jubilee lines). A single light on an arm of the Piglow indicates good service, two lights - minor delays and the whole arm lit to indicate more serious problems.
