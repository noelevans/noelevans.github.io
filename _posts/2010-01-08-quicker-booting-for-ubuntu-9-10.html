<p>If you're using Karmic Koala (or Lucid Lynx), the boot loader, Grub will seem a little bit different from previous Ubuntu releases. Previously to make changes like the timeout before loading the default OS, you edited /boot/grub/menu.lst</p>
<p>Grub is now configured by editing (as a root user)</p>
<pre>1.)  &gt;  <strong>sudo nano /etc/default/grub</strong></pre>
<p>Make changes to the GRUB_TIMEOUT or whatever else you needed to change. The config now needs to be made live. Do this by calling</p>
<pre>2.) &gt;   <strong>sudo update-grub</strong></pre>
<p>The changes are now written to an auto-generated file /boot/grub/grub.cfg but this file shouldn't be edited by hand.</p>
<p>For more info, see the Ubuntu's <a title="Grub2 Ubuntu docs" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2">official docs</a> on the subject.</p>
