<p>We recently took a break to Sussex and went one day to do the <a title="Winnie the Pooh walks from Gills Lap" href="http://www.ashdownforest.org/enjoy/walking/docs/Walk1_PoohWalksFromGillsLap.pdf">Winnie the Pooh Walk From Gills Lap</a>. The map on the PDF showing the route to the starting car park was tricky to divy-up with a larger map. This is the grid location for the car park where the route begins:</p>
<p><a title="Gills Lap" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=18&amp;q=51.064353,0.092989">Google maps Gills Lap link</a> (51.064353, 0.092989)</p>
<p>We also struggled for some time to find the bridge where Pooh Sticks were first played. Follow directions to this car park:</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=18&amp;q=51.078726,0.099677">Google maps "Pooh" car park link</a> (51.078726, 0.099677)</p>
<p>Follow the downhill path to the bridge. Note you first pass a smaller bridge and then come to the proper one after another 3-4 minutes of walking from the first. Walk 25m further from the Bridge and you find a tree stump with a door in the side.</p>
