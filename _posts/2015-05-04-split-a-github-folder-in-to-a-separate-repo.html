<p>You have a repository on Git called "all" and within that is a folder "folder_to_become_repo". You want to break this folder out to be a separate repository in your github account. Obviously, use your account name, not noelevans. Use these commands to make the change:</p>
<pre class="">mkdir ~/tmp-repo
cd ~/tmp-repo
git clone https://github.com/username/all.git
cd all
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter folder_to_become_repo master
# create a new repo "new-folder-repo" on github with the default options (link: https://github.com/new)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-folder-repo.git
git push

# Cleanup... being careful
rm -rf ~/tmp-repo</pre>
<p>You'll be prompted for your github account name and password when you do the push. After this you have a new repo in Github containing all of the contents from the directory "folder_to_become_repo". The history has been migrated to the new repo too!</p>
<p>Now clone the repository in your normal workspace and it's ready to go!</p>
