<p>I had no idea this existed until I took an assignment on Coursera. The work required a Windows-only application but suggested using the free Windows images legally distributed by MS themselves. The image works for three months without limitations but even after you could just remake the image from the zip files rather than put up with the hour time limit imposed on the image's uptime.</p>
<p>Follow the link <a title="Windows images for testing Internet Explorer versions" href="https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads">here</a> and download the version you want</p>
