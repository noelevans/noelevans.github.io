<p>You're probably reading this after getting to the Io chapter in Seven languages in seven weeks. If you're installing on Ubuntu these commands worked for me: (You might also need to apt-get install cmake and/or git)</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/stevedekorte/io.git
cd io
mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install</pre>
<p>You can now run "io" from a new shell.</p>
