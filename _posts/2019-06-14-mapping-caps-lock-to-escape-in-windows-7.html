<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]<br />"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,3a,00,46,00,01,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00    </p>

<p>I found this on <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_Windows">vim.fandom.com</a>. I first tried the "current user" method. This didn't work so I changed to using the "all users" option which was successful.</p>
