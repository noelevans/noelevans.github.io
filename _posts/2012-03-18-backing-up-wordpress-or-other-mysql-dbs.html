<p>These commands will backup and restore backups of a complete database to the current directory you're in. The -p option will prompt you for the DB's password (which you can get from wp-config.php)</p>
<pre>mysqldump your_db_name -u your_db_username -p &gt; backup_filename_to_create.sql
mysql your_db_name -h localhost -u your_db_username -p &lt; backup_filename_to_restore.sql</pre>
<p>Often the values for "your_db_name" and "your_db_username" are the same values. Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
