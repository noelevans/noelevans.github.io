<p>A complete guide to setting up a Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi) to connect wirelessly. Everything is setup from your laptop, writing to a micro SD card before plugging the card in to the RPi. I'm doing this on an Ubuntu computer. I imagine it is very similar from a Mac.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and unzip the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Lite</a> operating system (OS). You will now have an img file ready to write somewhere.</li>
<li>Download, install and run <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a> to write the raw operating system to the SD card. This is by far the easiest / safest way to write the OS to the card. (Note I have no liability for mistakes that may occur with this. Follow the instructions on Etcher's website)</li>
<li>Open a command window and enter:
<pre class="">sudo touch /media/xyz/boot/ssh</pre>
<p>where xyz is the path to the SD card and main_drive_abc will be some long text. One of these two is not necessary but I don't care which. This writes an empty file to these folders. They enable ssh so the RPi can be connected to using the SSH protocol from your laptop.</li>
<li>Now to use WiFi you'll need to give the RPi your username and password. This command will open an editor on the file that stores this information:
<pre class="">sudo nano /media/xyz/main_drive_abc/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</pre>
<p>At the bottom of the file add this:</p>
<pre class="">network={
    ssid="wifi_name"
    psk="wifi_password"
}</pre>
<p>Now press Ctrl+X to exit. Press "y" to save it as the correct filename.</li>
<li>Put the SD card in the RPi. Plug in the USB power cable. You are ready to connect from your laptop.</li>
<li>Find the RPi on your network using the command<br />
<span class="crayon-e">sudo </span><span class="crayon-v">arp</span><span class="crayon-o">-</span><span class="crayon-v">scan</span> <span class="crayon-o">--</span><span class="crayon-v">localnet</span><br />
Hopefully there will be an obvious choice. If not, try the following instruction changing the final number in the IP address below with each choice you see in arp-scan's output</li>
<li>Connect to the RPi with the command (changing 192.168.0.18 for whatever number your RPi is allocated on your network)
<pre class="">ssh pi@192.168.0.18</pre>
<p>The username you are using is pi. The password when prompted is "raspberry"</li>
<li>It is a huge security whole leaving the password unchanged. Run
<pre class="">sudo raspi-config</pre>
<p>This gives you an interactive menu. Change the password, update the system. You now have an operational Raspberry Pi to hack.</li>
</ol>
