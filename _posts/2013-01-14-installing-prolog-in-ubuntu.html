<p>Again, this is for use with the Seven languages in seven weeks book by Bruce Tate. With Ubuntu 12.10, I installed a version of GNU Prolog which so far is working fine with the examples. The package you need is gprolog:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install gprolog</pre>
<p>The version is a tiny bit older than Bruce uses -Â 1.3.0-6.1 rather than 1.3.1. As I said, no problems encounter yet though as a result.</p>
