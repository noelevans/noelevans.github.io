<p>You've tried to install the "Solver for Nonlinear Programming" for LibreOffice on Ubuntu but still can't use the new Solver when you open the dialog from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tools &gt; Solver...</p>
<p>Check you have the error I've encountered by looking up the nonlinear solver under</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tools &gt; Extension Manager...</p>
<p>"Error: The status of this extension is unknown".</p>
<p>The plugin was written for OpenOffice, not LibreOffice. You have to fix this by uninstalling LibreOffice and then installing OpenOffice.</p>
